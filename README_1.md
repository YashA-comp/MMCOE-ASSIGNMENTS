Our team has acknowledged and interpreted the problem well. We listed a set of rules we believed would be essential to generate a strong and secure password on a small scale. They include:
i) The length of the password should be at least 8 characters
ii) The password should contain at least one small letter (a to z)
iii) The password should contain at least one capital letter (A to Z)
iv) The password should contain at least one special character (limited to !, @, #, and $)
